  <h1>👋🏿, I'm Diane. A product designer based in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c6X9GvBd5TL8VwK38">Bay Area</a>.</h1>
  <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
  <p>
  I'm passionate about delivering experiences that can unlock human potential. Whether its designing web sites, fine-tuning on-boarding, or developing testing strategies, I’m focused on tapping into what motivates people.

In my past life, years of experience as a data-driven marketer has allowed me to understand the balance between meeting the needs of the user and satisfying business goals. I love to simplify the complex and collaborate with others.

  <h2>Other Things About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm originally from Grand Rapids, MI. When I'm not in Sketch or reading a fun design book I like to; listen to *all* the podcasts, play video games, board games, and take long hikes (sometimes on the beach) with my rescue pup, Atlas. I'm a hot sauce fanatic and have been in many informal contests.</p>
