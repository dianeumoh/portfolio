  <h1>👋🏿, I'm Diane. A product designer based in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/c6X9GvBd5TL8VwK38">Bay Area</a>.</h1>
  <p>
  I'm passionate about delivering experiences that can unlock human potential. Whether its designing web sites, fine-tuning on-boarding, or developing testing strategies, I’m focused on tapping into what motivates people.

In my past life, years of experience as a data-driven marketer has allowed me to understand the balance between meeting the needs of the user and satisfying business goals. I love to simplify the complex and collaborate with others.

  <h3>Other things about me</h3>
  <p>I'm originally from Grand Rapids, MI. When I'm not in Sketch or reading a fun design book I like to listen to *all* the podcasts, level up my Warlock in WoW Classic, and take long hikes, with my rescue pup, Atlas.</p>
